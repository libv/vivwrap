vivwrap is a quick vivante IOCTL dumping tool.

Features:
---------

Very few.

This was written for a very specific version of the vivante kernel driver for
which the headers are directly included. It just provides a high level trace
of the ioctls as the way vivante uses ioctls is very very broken and not very
helpful for debugging.

This is by no means a command stream dumper.

By superimposing symbols (through LD_PRELOAD), it could also be possible to
correlate GL/Toolkit/Display server calls to the vivante ioctls to get a
clearer picture of what exactly is going wrong.

Compatibility:
--------------

Very limited. The included headers were taken straight from a vendor kernel
tree. Version of the galcore driver is 4.6.9.9754.

Build:
------

Very rudimentary.

Just add your toolchain to your path and run:

     make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-

Running:
--------

Run your target application with:

    LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libvivwrap.so target_application

And you should see /tmp/viv_wrap.log start filling up.

You can alter the log destination by setting the VIV_WRAP_LOG environment
variable.
